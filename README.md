# Dental Caries Detection

## Overview
Dental caries, commonly known as tooth decay or cavities, is a widespread oral health issue caused by bacteria in the mouth producing acids that destroy the tooth's enamel. This project focuses on detecting dental caries at an early stage using advanced techniques like X-rays, laser fluorescence, and AI-based image analysis.

## Features
- **Automated Detection**: Uses advanced image processing and AI algorithms to detect early signs of dental caries.
- **Non-invasive Analysis**: Implements techniques like X-rays and laser fluorescence to detect caries without invasive procedures.
- **Accurate Diagnosis**: Reduces human error, providing more precise and consistent results for caries detection.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use dashboard for dental professionals to analyze results and generate reports.

## Technologies Used
-
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building the frontend UI.
